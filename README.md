Please keep in mind this is the earlist working version of my project and there are a lot of changes I am going to implement before I consider this complete.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is the code for the website of my photo sharing platform. <a href="https://github.com/alexbenko/ourlife"> Click me to see the backend service that serves the images, provides authentication, and auto renweing ssl certs.</a>
</br>

This project is a demonstration of my React and Front end speciatly. Currently in this project I use async/await syntax, React hooks, custom components, conditonal rendering, fetch API calls to my server, loading static content from my server , and dynamic CSS.

I will most likely extend this to being my portfolio site as well, but for now I am focusing on the photo sharing platform..

There are many features I want to implement:

<ol>
  <li>Authentication Portal</li>
  <li>Allowing Authenticated users to edit, delete, and add new content to the photo sharing portion. (Users will only be me and my partner.)</li>
  <li>View a Single Image</li>
</ol>
